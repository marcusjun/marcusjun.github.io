I wanted to share how I've been learning the content of the coding bootcamp.

I take notes with paper and pencil. Writing things down helps me to remember.

When I'm working on a lab, sometimes it's difficult for me to remember which lesson or lecture contains the information I'm looking for. It's easier for me to find the info in my notes.

I'll also write down snippets and full pieces of code. Sometimes I'll write the code as a template with blank spaces for variable data or I'll just copy the sample code from the lessons. This helps me to learn the syntax and get familiar with the pattern.

For example, in the SQL lessons I forgot the command to display column headers and automatically adjust the column width. I wrote down the code in my spiral notebook and have referred to it many times.

Taking notes also helps me to translate the lesson into me-speak that is easier for me to understand. Even if how I describe something may not be technically correct, using my own words helps me to digest the info and remember what I learned.

As I'm watching the video lectures, I'll write down the timestamps (Ex: 20:45) and the concept or code discussed. So later, if I have to refer back to the video, I don't have to scroll through an hour long lecture to find the section I'm looking for.
