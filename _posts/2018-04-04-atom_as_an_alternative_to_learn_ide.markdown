I was plodding through the HTML and CSS unit and in the instructional videos the presenter uses Sublime text. I've tried to follow along in Learn IDE but it has some limitations on saving and it seems like Learn IDE is specifically geared toward the labs.

I downloaded Atom to use as a general, HTML editor. Learn IDE is built on Atom so the interface is familiar and even the colors in the code are the same. https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/

I also mentioned this before but I had some trouble in the terminal when I tried to push changes up to github. During the codealong labs, when the instructor forks a branch from github and then later pushes changes to the master branch, I've been following along but haven't actually executed the commands.

Instead I relied on the learn submit command in Learn IDE to push changes to my github so I know my code is safe there. In future projects, I'll probably use GIthub Desktop to make branches and push changes rather than in the terminal window.
